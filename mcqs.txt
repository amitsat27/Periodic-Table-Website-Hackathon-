        adpushup.triggerAd("e25be634-2f62-4ed5-978b-3aaec04c8aca");
    });



2. What happens to the size of atoms of elements of p-block as we move from left to right in the same period?
a) Size increases
b) Size decreases
c) Size does not change
d) Size increases then decreases
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The size of the atoms of the elements decrease from left to right in the same period. Considering the row to be the same, the electrons are added to the same shell. However, the increase in atomic number reflects the increase in number of protons i.e. the positive charge. Hence, the overall effective nuclear charge increases. Consequently, the electron cloud is pulled even more closer to the nucleus of the atom. Therefore, the size decreases.

3. What is the maximum covalency of the nitrogen atom?
a) One
b) Two
c) Three
d) Four
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Covalency of an atom refers to the number of electrons that atom can share to form chemical bonds. Usually it is the number of bonds formed by the atom. In case of nitrogen, its atom can share up to four electrons, one in the s-subshell and the other three in the p-subshell. In addition to this, absence of d-orbitals restricts its covalency to four only.

4. Why does nitrogen show poor tendency towards catenation?
a) N atom can form multiple pπ – pπ bonds
b) Octet of N2 is complete unlike carbon
c) The N ≡ N is unreactive at room temperature
d) The N – N single bond is weaker and unstable
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The N – N single bond is highly weak and unstable due to high magnitude of inter-electronic repulsions of non-bonding electrons which in turn is caused by the single bond’s small bond length. As a result the catenation tendency becomes weaker due to the mentioned factors leading to instability.

5. What is the primary product of  Haber-Bosch process?
a) Ammonia
b) Nitric acid
c) Nitrous acid
d) Pyridine
View AnswerAnswer: a

2. Which of the following is true regarding nitric acid?
a) It is a strong reducing agent
b) It is a weak oxidizing agent
c) Its basicity is unity
d) It is non-planar in gaseous state
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Nitric acid is a very weak reducing agent since it has a polar O – H bond. This breaks to donate the H+ ion which is why it is a strong oxidizing agent and a strong acid. Since there is only one cleavable O – H bond, the basicity of nitric acid is unity (one HNO3 molecule can donate only 1 H+ ion). It exists as a planar molecule in vapor phase.

3. Which of the following reactions best represents lab scale preparation of nitric acid?
a) 3HNO2 → HNO3 + H2O + 2NO
b) NO2 + O2 → NO3
c) NaNO3 + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + HNO3
d) 3NO2 + H2O → 2HNO3 + NO
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The most appropriate lab scale preparation method of nitric acid, HNO3 is using an alkali nitrate salt and react it with concentration nitric acid in a glass retort.  Nitrous acid being highly unstable decomposes into nitric acid. The other two sets of reaction represent the industrial process of manufacturing nitric acid i.e. Ostwald’s process.

    });



2. Which allotrope of phosphorus is the most reactive?
a) White phosphorus
b) Metal phosphorus
c) Red phosphorus
d)  Beta-black phosphorus
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The three allotropic forms of phosphorus differ widely in their chemical reactivity in which white phosphorus is the most reactive while black and red phosphorus are less reactive. White phosphorus is made up of discrete P4 tetrahedra which are subjected to very high angular strain as the angles is 60 degrees. This high angular strain makes white phosphorus unstable and highly reactive.

3. Red phosphorus is kept under water to protect it from air.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: White phosphorus is a highly reactive clement and must be stored underwater for safekeeping to prevent it from catching fire spontaneously in the air. In water, white phosphorus reacts with oxygen within hours or days. In water with low oxygen, white phosphorus may degrade to a highly toxic compound called phosphine, which eventually evaporates to the air and is changed to less harmful chemicals.

Explanation: In moist air, phosphorus pentachloride undergoes hydrolysis to first form POCl3 and then finally phosphoric acid.
PCl3 + H2O → POCl3 + 2HCl
POCl3 + 3H2O → H3PO4 + 3HCl
However, with excess of water, PCl5 reacts violently to form H3PO4 and HCl.
PCl5 + 4H2O (excess) → H3PO4 + 5HCl.

10. Which group 16 element has the highest tendency for catenation?
a) Oxygen
b) Sulphur
c) Selenium
d) Polonium
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Sulphur has a stronger tendency for catenation than Oxygen. Due to small size, the lone pairs on the Oxygen atoms repel the bond pair of the O-O bond to a greater extent than the lone pairs of electrons on the Sulphur atoms in S-S bond. As a result, S-S bond is much stronger than O-O bond and hence Sulphur has a much stronger tendency for catenation than Oxygen.

11. Which group 16 element has 8 allotropic forms?
a) Sulphur
b) Oxygen
c) Selenium
d) Polonium
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Selenium has eight allotropic forms, of which three are red monoclinic forms containing Se8 rings. The thermodynamically most stable form is grey hexagonal metallic Selenium which consists of polymeric helical chains.

12. What is the most reactive element of group 16?
a) Oxygen
b) Sulphur
c) Tellurium
d) Selenium
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Oxygen is the most reactive element of group 16. It is the second most electronegative element in the periodic table (EN=3.5), the first being fluorine (EN=4.0), making it more reactive than the other elements of the group.

13. Which of the following is a photosensitive element?
a) S
b) Se
c) O
d) Po
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The grey form of Selenium (metallic) and Tellurium consist of parallel chains held by weak metallic bonds. In the presence of light, the weak metallic bonds are excited and as a result, the number of free electrons increases and so does the conductivity. Thus, these elements conduct electricity significantly only in the presence of light. That is why Se and Te are called photosensitive elements.

14. What is the correct order of reactivity of group 16 elements?
a) O > Se > S > Te > Po
b) S > O > Te > Po > Se
c) S > O > Se > Te > Po
d) O > S > Se > Te > Po
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Oxygen is the most reactive group 16 element. Its reactivity is only slightly less than the most reactive elements, halogens. Sulphur is also very reactive particularly at high temperatures which helps in the cleavage of S-S bonds present in S8 molecules. However, as we move down the group, the reactivity decreases, i.e., O > S > Se > Te > Po.

15. Which of the following is not poisonous?
a) H2O
b) H2S
c) H2Se
d) H2Te
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The hydride of Oxygen, i.e., H2O is a colourless, odourless liquid while the hydrides of all the other group 16 elements are unpleasant, foul smelling, poisonous gases. H2O has the highest boiling point of 373 K amongst the hydrides of group 16 elements.

1. What type of oxides is formed by metals?
a) Oxides with pH = 7
b) Oxides with pH > -log10[1 x 10-7] 
c) Oxides with pH <= -log10[1 x 10-7] 
d) Amphoteric oxides
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Metals usually form basic oxides. E.g. sodium, potassium,  calcium. Meaning, the pH of the salts is greater than 7 on the pH scale. pH is calculated as the negative logarithm of concentration of hydronium ions. Metals form oxides because upon dissolution, they release oxide ions which in turn give hydroxide (basic) ions. However, a few metals form oxides which are both acidic and basic, called amphoteric oxides. E.g.  zinc, lead.

    });



2. Which of the following element is most reactive?
a) Chlorine
b) Fluorine
c) Bromine
d) Iodine
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Of all the halogens, fluorine is the most reactive and hence is also called super halogen. Fluorine is also the most electronegative (EN = 4.0) element in the periodic table. This indicates that fluorine has a high tendency to gain electrons from other elements with lower electronegativities.

3. Which of the following halogen is radioactive?
a) Fluorine
b) Bromine
c) Astatine
d) Chlorine
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Astatine (Atomic No. = 85, Symbol-At) is radioactive and hence occurs in nature only in traces. Therefore, not much is known about its chemistry, though it might be expected to be a metalloid.

        adpushup.triggerAd("7cee830d-5f11-4a2b-b356-93cc453475a0");
    });



4. Halogens do not occur in the free state.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Halogens are highly reactive elements and hence do not occur in the free state or native state. They mainly occur in the combined state in the form of their halide (X–) salts although iodine also occurs as iodate (IO3–).

5. Which of the following is not a mineral of fluorine?
a) Fluorspar
b) Cryolite
c) Fluoroapatite
d) Carnallite
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Fluorine occurs as insoluble fluorides to the extent of 0.07% in the earth’s crust. The chief minerals of fluorine are:

Fluorspar, CaF2
Cryolite, Na3AlF6
Fluoroapatite, CaF2.3Ca3(PO4)2

        adpushup.triggerAd("fdd9bf87-4faf-4493-82b4-e5538b31931a");
    });



6. What is the general electronic configuration of the halogens?
a) ns2np5
b) ns2np2
c) ns2np3
d) ns2np4
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The elements of group 17 have seven electrons in the valence shell and hence their general electronic configuration is ns2np5, i.e., ns2npx2npy2npz1 where n = 2-6. Thus, they contain one electron less than the nearest inert gas configuration.

7. What is the correct order of enthalpy of dissociation of halogens?
a) F2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2
b) Cl2 > Br2 > F2 > I2
c) Cl2 > F2 > Br2 > I2
d) F2 > Br2 > Cl2 > I2
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Enthalpy of dissociation decreases as the bond distance increases from F2 to I2 due to a corresponding increase in the size of the atom as we move down the group from F to I. The F-F bond dissociation enthalpy is, however, smaller than that of Cl-Cl and even smaller than that of Br-Br. This is due to the reason that F atom is very small and hence the electron-electron repulsions between the lone pairs of electrons are very large.

    });



8. What is the atomicity of halogens?
a) Monoatomic
b) Diatomic
c) Triatomic
d) Octatomic
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Each halogen has one electron less than the nearest inert gas. As a result, halogens are very reactive elements. They readily share their single unpaired electron with other atoms to form covalent bonds. Thus, all halogens exist as diatomic molecules.

9. Who discovered the element chlorine?
a) Joseph Priestley
b) Antoine Lavoisier
c) Humphry Davy
d) Wilhelm Scheele
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Chlorine was discovered in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele by heating HCl with MnO2. In 1810, Davy established its elementary nature and suggested the name chlorine on the basis of its colour (Greek, chloros = greenish yellow).

a) Atomic size
b) Orbital configuration
c) Very light
d) Hard elements
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Alloys are combinations of metals or elements in the form of a compound or a solution. Transition elements are highly capable in forming alloys because they have similar atomic size and can substitute each of their positions in a crystal lattice.

3. Which of the following has the highest atomic number?
a) Scandium
b) Titanium
c) Cadmium
d) Lanthanum
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: In the periodic table, when you move down the group, the atomic number increases. In the given options, scandium and titanium belong to the 3d series, cadmium belongs to the 4d series and Lanthanum belongs to the 5d series. Therefore, Lanthanum will have the highest atomic number.

4. What is the oxidation state exhibited by actinium?
a) +4
b) +1
c) +2
d) +3
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Actinium is the first member of the actinoid series. Its atomic number is 89. The electronic configuration of actinium is [Rn]6d17s2. It has only three electrons to lose. Therefore, actinium is generally only found in the +3-oxidation state.

5. Where does the last electron of d-block element go?
a) nd
b) (n-1)d
c) np
d) (n-1)s
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In these elements, the last electron enters the d orbital of the penultimate shell, i.e., the last electron goes to (n-1) d orbital. Hence, these elements are named as d-block elements. These elements have partly filled d-subshells in their elementary form or in their simple ions.

    });



6. Why does Zinc not show variable valency?
a) Complete ‘d’ subshell
b) Inert pair effect
c) 4s2 subshell
d) 4s3 subshell
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Both zinc and mercury have completely filled d-orbital. So, they tend to lose only 2 electrons from their outermost shell and have only one oxidation state. Hence, they only show a valency of +2 and do not show variable valency.

7. What is the common oxidation state of scandium? (At. No. of Sc = 21)
a) +4
b) +3
c) +1
d) +5
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. A diagonal relationship exists between the behaviour of magnesium and scandium, just as there is between beryllium and aluminium. In the chemical compounds of the elements in group 3, the predominant oxidation state is +3.

    });



8. Among d-block elements, the most abundant element belongs to the first transition state.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Iron and titanium are the most abundantly found transition elements. The most abundant transition metal in Earth’s solid crust is iron, which is fourth among all elements and second (to aluminum) among metals in crustal abundance.

9. Which of the following statement is correct?
a) The properties of various actinoids are very similar
b) 4f and 5f orbitals are equally shielded
c) D-block elements show irregular and erratic chemical properties
d) 4d and 5d orbitals are equally shielded
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: There is very little variance in the atomic size of the actinoids and so, they show similar properties. 4f and 5f orbitals belong to different energy levels and so are unequally shielded. The same applies to the 4d and 5d orbitals. The d-block elements are known to show irregular and erratic chemical properties.

    });



10. The main factor for the cause of lanthanide contraction is poorer shielding of 5d electrons by 4f electrons.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Lanthanide contraction is the steady decrease in the size of the atoms with increasing atomic number from lanthanum (atomic number 57) through lutetium (atomic number 71). The Lanthanide Contraction is caused by a poor shielding effect of the 4f electrons. It’s due to lanthanide contraction, as the atomic number increases, the size of the lanthanide atoms and their tripositive ions decreases.

« Prev - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Position of the Periodic Table» Next - Chemistry Questions and Answers – General Properties of the Transition Elements (D-Block) 
This set of Chemistry Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “General Properties of the Transition Elements (D-Block)”.
1. The d-electrons affect the properties of the transition elements to a great extent.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The transition elements differ from one another only in the number of electrons in the d-orbitals of the penultimate shell. The d-orbitals of the transition elements project to the periphery of the atom more than s and p-orbitals. Therefore, the d-electrons affect the properties of transition elements to a great extent.

        adpushup.triggerAd("e25be634-2f62-4ed5-978b-3aaec04c8aca");
    });



2. Why is there an increase in the atomic radius of transition elements at the end of the period?
a) Increased electron-electron repulsions
b) Decreased electron-electron repulsions
c) Increase in nuclear charge
d) Increase in atomic mass
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Near the end of the period, the increased electron-electron repulsions between added electrons in the same orbitals are greater than the attractive forces due to increased nuclear charge. This results in the expansion of the electron cloud and therefore, increases the atomic size.

3.Which of the following iswhy the atomic radii of the second and third transition series are almost same?
a) Actinoid contraction
b) Radioactive nature
c) Lanthanoid contraction
d) Filled d-orbital
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In the atoms of the second transition series, the number of shells increases and so, their atomic radii is greater than that of the first transition series. The atomic radii of the second and third transition series are almost same due to lanthanoid contraction.

        adpushup.triggerAd("7cee830d-5f11-4a2b-b356-93cc453475a0");
    });



4. The decrease in atomic size of the d-block elements in a series is small after midway.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In the beginning of the series, the atomic radius decreases with increase in atomic number as the nuclear charge increases and the shielding effect of the d-electrons is small. After midway, the increased number of d-electrons show an increase in shielding effect which counterbalances the increase in nuclear charge. Therefore, the decrease in atomic radius post midway is minimal.

5. Which of the following is not a property of a transition metal?
a) They are lustrous
b) They are malleable
c) They are ductile
d) They have low boiling points
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The transition metals exhibit all the characteristics of metals. They are hard, lustrous, malleable and ductile, have high melting and boiling points, high thermal and electrical conductivity and high tensile strength.

        adpushup.triggerAd("fdd9bf87-4faf-4493-82b4-e5538b31931a");
    });



6. What type of bond do the transition elements form with themselves?
a) Ionic bond
b) Covalent bond
c) Coordinate bond
d) Metallic bond
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Transition elements have relatively low ionization energies and have one or two electrons in their outermost energy level. As a result, they form metallic bonds. This is also the reason behind the metallic properties of transition elements.

7. Which of the following is not a very hard metal?
a) Chromium
b) Molybdenum
c) Tungsten
d) Zinc
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Greater the number of unpaired electrons, stronger is the bonding due to overlapping of unpaired electrons between different metal atoms. Cr, Mo and W have maximum unpaired d-electrons and are harder metals whereas Zn, Cd and Hg are not very hard due to the absence of unpaired electrons.

a) Manganese has an abnormally low boiling point
b) Transition elements have low enthalpies of atomisation
c) Transition elements exhibit metallic bonding
d) Transition metals generally have a high boiling point
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Transition metals generally have high melting and boiling points. Magnesium and technetium have abnormally low boiling points. This is due to the strong metallic bonds between the atoms. They have high enthalpies of atomization.

9. Which of the following element has the highest density among transition metals?
a) Iridium
b) Osmium
c) Scandium
d) Chromium
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Among the d-block elements, iridium has the highest density (22.61 g cm-3) whereas scandium has the lowest density (3.43 g cm-3). Osmium has slightly lesser density (22.59 g cm-3) than iridium.

    });



10. Which of the following element has the highest ionisation enthalpy?
a) Scandium
b) Vanadium
c) Copper
d) Zinc
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Ionisation enthalpy shows only a little variation on moving along the period of d-block elements. The first ionisation enthalpy of zinc, cadmium and mercury are higher than the other elements in their respective periods because of the fully filled (n-1)d10ns2 configuration.

« Prev - Chemistry Questions and Answers – General Properties of the Transition Elements (D-Block)» Next - Chemistry Questions and Answers – D and F-Block Elements – Lanthanoids 
This set of Chemistry Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “D and F-Block Elements – Lanthanoids”.
1. The lanthanides are d-block elements.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The lanthanides are elements in which the differentiating electron enters (n-2)f-orbital of anti-penultimate shell and are called as f-block elements. These have three outer shells incomplete. Thus, lanthanides are f-block elements, not d-block.

    var adpushup = adpushup || {};
    adpushup.que = adpushup.que || [];
    adpushup.que.push(function() {
        adpushup.triggerAd("e25be634-2f62-4ed5-978b-3aaec04c8aca");
    });



2. What is the general electronic configuration of the lanthanides?
a) (n-2)f 1-14 (n-1)d 1-10 ns2
b) (n-2)f 1-14 (n-1)d 1-2 ns2
c) (n-2)f 1-14 (n-1)d 0-1 ns2
d) (n-2)f 1-14 (n-1)d 0 ns2
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In lanthanides, the differentiating electron occupies 4f subshell and are rarely found on the earth’s crust, so called rare earths. The general electronic configuration of lanthanides is 6s25d0-14f1-14.

3. What happens to the atomic size of the lanthanides with increase in atomic number?
a) The radius remains unchanged
b) The radius decreases
c) The radius increases
d) The radius first increases and then decreases
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic radii of the lanthanides with an increase in atomic number is called lanthanide contraction. It occurs due to the poor shielding effect of the 4f electrons.

        adpushup.triggerAd("7cee830d-5f11-4a2b-b356-93cc453475a0");
    });



4. Which of the following is not a consequence of lanthanide contraction?
a) From La+3 to Lu+3, the ionic radii changes from 106 pm to 85 pm
b) As the size of the lanthanide ions decreases the basic strength increases
c) The basic character of oxides and hydroxides decreases with increase in atomic number
d) The atomic radii of 4d and 5d series is similar
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The small average decreases in the atomic size is responsible for a small decrease in electronegativity and S.O.P of lanthanides. As the size of the lanthanide ions decreases the covalent character of M—OH bond increases and hence basic strength decreases.

5. What is the most common oxidation state of lanthanides?
a) +2
b) +4
c) +6
d) +3
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The most common and stable oxidation state of lanthanides is +3. Some elements also exhibit +4 oxidation states. Some elements exhibit +2 oxidation state also due to their half-filled, fully-filled and noble gas configuration.

        adpushup.triggerAd("fdd9bf87-4faf-4493-82b4-e5538b31931a");
    });



6. In lanthanides, Ce changes from +4 to +3 oxidation state.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In lanthanides, Ce changes from +4 to +3 oxidation state. Formation of Ce4+ is favorable due to its noble gas configuration. However, Ce+4 changes to Ce+3 as it is a strong oxidizing agent. The E° value of Ce+4/Ce+3 is +1.74 V.

7. Which of the following is not a property of lanthanides?
a) They are soft metals with white silvery color
b) They tarnish rapidly by air
c) The hardness of the metals increases with increase in the atomic number
d) The melting point of the metal ranges from 500-1000K
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: All lanthanides are soft metals with silvery white color. They tarnish rapidly by air. With increase in atomic number, the harness of these metals also increases. The melting points of the lanthanides ranges from 1000 to 1200K but samarium melts at 1623K.

8. Which of the following lanthanide ions do not exhibit color?
a) Lu+3 and Ln+3
b) Lu+2 and Ln+2
c) Ce+3 and Ce+3
d) Pr+4 and Ce+4
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Many trivalent lanthanide ions are colored both in the solid state and in aqueous state due to f-f electronic transition. Lu+3 and Ln+3 don’t exhibit color due to absence of unpaired electrons. All lanthanide ions except La+3, Ce+3 and Lu+3 are paramagnetic due to presence of unpaired electrons.

9. Which of the following is the correct order of arrangement of the first five lanthanides according to atomic number?
a) La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm
b) La, Pr, Ce, Pm, Nd

        adpushup.triggerAd("e25be634-2f62-4ed5-978b-3aaec04c8aca");
    });



2. Which property of actinoids cannot be explained?
a) Radioactive
b) Oxidation
c) Magnetic
d) Acidic
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Their magnetic properties cannot be explained easily, as they are more complex. The 5f bands formed due to 5f-5f wave function overlap or to hybridisation with s, p or d electrons. As a result of the band formation, a wide variety of magnetic phenomena may occur.

3. Which is the most stable oxidation state of actinoids?
a) +2
b) +3
c) +4
d) +5
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Actinoids show variable oxidation states because of the smaller energy gap between 5f, 6d and 7s orbitals. Though 3+ is the most stable oxidation state, other oxidation states are possible because of the good shielding of f-electrons.

    });



4. All actinoids are diamagnetic in nature.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Substances which are weakly repelled by a magnetic field are said to be diamagnetic. All actinoids are paramagnetic in nature due to the presence of unpaired electrons. This means that they are weakly attracted by a magnetic field.

5. Actinoids are mostly attacked by which acid?
a) Hydrochloric acid
b) Nitric acid
c) Sulphuric acid
d) Boric acid
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Actinoids are highly reactive metals especially in the finely divided state. All these metals are attacked by hydrochloric acid but the effect of nitric acid is very small due to the formation of a protective oxide layer on their surface.

« Prev - Chemistry Questions and Answers – D and F-Block Elements – Actinoids» Next - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Werner’s Theory of Coordination Compounds 
This set of Chemistry Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Werner’s Theory of Coordination Compounds”.
1. What was the term proposed by Werner for the number of groups bound directly to the metal ion in a coordination complex?
a) Primary valence
b) Secondary valence
c) Oxidation number
d) Polyhedra
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Primary valence of a metal ion is also known as its oxidation number. The secondary valence is equal to coordination number and it is fixed for a metal. Coordination polyhedra is the term for the spatial arrangements of the groups/ions around the metal.

    });



2. What is the colour of the compound CoCl3.5NH3?
a) Yellow
b) Purple
c) Green
d) Violet
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The different compounds of cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia show distinct properties, most notably with respect to colour and conductivity measurements in solution.

3. If the secondary valence in CoCl3.4NH3 is six, the solution conductivity in silver nitrate corresponds to ________ electrolyte.
a) 1:1
b) 1:2
c) 1:3
d) 1:4
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Werner observed that ‘x’ mol of AgCl was precipitated per mole of CoCl3.4NH3 with excess silver nitrate. Currently, there are seven groups attached to the cobalt atom. For the secondary valence to be six, one of the chloride (x=1) has to be precipitated as AgCl, therefore 1:1 electrolyte.

    });



4. Which is the counter ion in [Pd(NH3)4]2+2Cl–?
a) Pd2+
b) [Pd(NH3)4]2+
c) Cl–
d) It does not have a counter ion
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In coordination compounds, the ions outside the square brackets are called counter ions, and the species within the square bracket are the coordination entities.

5. Werner proposed that the primary valences are ionizable and are satisfied only by positive ions.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: According to Werner’s postulates, primary valences are ionizable and are satisfied by negative ions. Whereas, secondary valences are non-ionizable, and these are satisfied by neutral molecules or negative ions.

        adpushup.triggerAd("fdd9bf87-4faf-4493-82b4-e5538b31931a");
    });



6. Werner postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar geometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of ________
a) alkali metals
b) lanthanides
c) actinides
d) transition metals
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Transition metals bond a bit differently from main group elements. They form coordinate covalent bonds and are often the central metal ion/atom of coordination complexes. Thus, octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar shapes are more common in transition metal central atoms.

7. Given that 1 mol of NiCl2.6H2O with excess AgNO3 precipitates 2 mols of AgCl, what is the secondary valence of Ni?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 4
d) 6
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: After the reaction, it will form [Ni(H2O)6]2- and 2Cl– in which the former is the coordination complex. There are six water molecules bound to Ni, which makes the secondary valence of Ni as 6.

        adpushup.triggerAd("21eae76a-c83f-42b0-aec5-01d590a53f37");
    });



8. If Pt in PtCl4.2HCl has a secondary valence of 6, how many mols of AgCl will 1 mol of the compound precipitate with excess AgNO3?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) 4
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Since the secondary valence is 6, the compound should have six groups linked to Pt atom. But it already has six groups linked to it and cannot lose any Cl atoms to form AgCl. Hence, no AgCl will be produced.

9. What is the sum of the oxidation number of cobalt in [Co(H2O)(CN)(en)2]2+and [CoBr2(en)2]+?
a) +3
b) +4
c) +5
d) +6
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: In [Co(H2O)(CN)(en)2]2+, the overall charge is +2 and 0, -1 and 0 on H2O, CN and en groups respectively. If ‘x’ is the oxidation number of Co, then (x + 0 – 1 + 0 = +2), which implies x=+3. Similarly, in [CoBr2(en)2]+, the charge on Br is -1, so if ‘y’ is the oxidation number of Co, then (y – 2 + 0 = +1), which implies y=+3. Therefore, the sum of the oxidation numbers is 3 + 3 = 6.

        adpushup.triggerAd("90f55663-effd-4105-b1e7-29d86b526544");
    });



10. Predict the secondary valence of Pt within the complex ion from the equation shown below.

a) 1
b) 3
c) 6
d) 9
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: It is given that 3 parts of the platinum chloride compounds in excess silver nitrate gives 9 parts of AgCl and 3 parts of the complex ion. There are two approaches to this:
Method 1 (By balancing): It is seen that (3 x 4 = 12) atoms of Cl on the left give (9 x 1 = 9) on the right, which leaves 3 Cl atoms, that is one in each complex ion. Now, each complex ion has 1 Cl and 5 NH3 linked to Pt, giving a secondary valence of 6.
Method 2 (By proportioning): 3 mols gives 9 mols, which implies, 1 part of compound will give 3 parts of AgCl. Thus, only one Cl atom remains with the compound along with 5 NH3 molecules, giving Pt a secondary valence of 6.

11. What is the primary valence of iron in the coordination entity of compound Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3?
a) 0
b) +2
c) +3
d) +4
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: This compound, also known as Prussian blue, dissociates into 4 Fe3+ and 3[Fe(CN)6]4- ions, of which the latter is the coordination entity having a charge of -4. The Fe atom in question is the one inside the bracket. Since CN has a charge of -1 and there are 6 of them, the primary valence of Fe will be 6 – 4 = +2.

12. [Fe(CN)6]4- is an example of a _______
a) Coordination compound
b) Complex ion
c) Double salt
d) Complex salt
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: [Fe(CN)6]4- is the coordination complex ion of the coordination compound K4[Fe(CN6)], or potassium ferrocyanide, which is also a complex salt. Coordination complexes are also known as coordination entities.

13. Which of the following is a complex salt?
a) Potassium aluminium sulphate
b) Ammonium iron(ll) sulphate
c) Carnallite
d) Potassium ferrocyanide
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Potassium ferrocyanide, K4[Fe(CN6)], is a complex salt that does not dissociate into Fe2+ and CN– ions when dissolved in water. The other three, i.e., potash alum, carnallite and Mohr’s salt are double salt that dissociate into simple ions completely when dissolved in water.

14. The compound tetraamminecopper(II) sulphate, or [Cu(NH3)4]SO4.5H2O, a double salt.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The given compound is a coordination compound made of a complex ion, i.e., [Cu(NH3)4]2+ which does not dissociate into its constituent ions when dissolved. Hence, it is a complex salt and not a double salt.

10. The square planar complex [MABCD] is known to form three isomers, two cis and one trans. Shown below are the two cis isomers of the complex. Identify the third trans isomer.

a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: If you observe the two given cis isomers, it can be seen that they are formed by simply swapping the positions of B and C, but both of them are adjacent to each other in both isomers. So, to obtain the trans isomer, the ligands B and C should lie opposite to each other. The other incorrect options are the same cis isomers but are depicted in different orientations.

11. Which of the following do not show geometrical isomerism? (Assume all ligands are unidentate)
a) Square planar [MXL3] 
b) Square planar [MX2L2] 
c) Octahedral [MX2L4] 
d) Octahedral [MX3L3] 
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In square planar complexes, the type [MXL3] does not have any isomers as there is no pair of ligands that can be arranged adjacent to or opposite each other to form cis or trans forms respectively. All possible combinations result in the same spatial arrangement.

12. In the coordination entity [Co(NH3)3(NO2)3], if all three N atoms of the amine ligands occupy adjacent positions at the corners of an octahedral face, the geometrical isomer formed is known as _______ isomer.
a) cis
b) trans
c) fac
d) mer
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Octahedral entities of the type [MA3B3] form two types of isomers based on whether the same ligand groups occupy adjacent positions on the octahedral face (fac) or positions around the meridian of the octahedron (mer).

13. Which of the following compounds has a meridional isomer?
a) [Fe(NO)5Br]+
b) [Al(CO)3(NO2)3] 
c) [K(NH)3)4(NO)2]+
d) [Fe(H2O)2(CO)2(NO)2]3+
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Fac-mer isomerism is only exhibited in octahedral coordination entities of the type [MA3B3] depending on the positions of the similar ligands.

14. Optical isomers are also known as __________
a) structural isomers
b) facial isomers
c) meridional isomers
d) enantiomers
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Optical isomers are different forms of the same complex that are mirror images of each other, and which cannot be superimposed. They are chiral complexes also known as enantiomers.

15. The optical isomer that rotates the plane of polarised in the clockwise direction is called ______
a) trans
b) dextro
c) mer
d) laevo
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The optical isomers are of two types based on the direction they rotate the plane of polarised light in a polarimeter. If it rotates it to the right, it is called dextro and if it rotates it to the left, it is called laevo.

    });



2. How many stereoisomers does the following compound have?

a) 0
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Firstly, the compound can have 2 geometric isomers, cis and trans, depending on whether similar ligands are placed adjacent to or opposite each other. Furthermore, one of them, i.e. the cis form is optically active and has two non-superimposable forms. This means that the cis form is both a geometric isomers as well as an optical isomer. Hence, there are 3 stereoisomers (1 geometric, 1 optical, 1 both geometric and optical).

3. The coordination entity [CrCl2(ox)2]3- is optically active.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: [CrCl2(ox)2]3- has two geometric isomers, cis and trans. The trans isomer is achiral and only the cis isomer is optically active. Thus, the statement is not always true.

4. Identify the type of isomerism exhibited by the following structures.

a) Geometric isomerism
b) Optical isomerism
c) Linkage isomerism
d) Coordination isomerism
View AnswerAnswer:  c
Explanation: Geometric and optical isomerism are types of stereoisomerism in which the chemical bonds remain same. The two structures shown have different chemical bonds between the central atom (Co) and the ligand group (NO2). Nitrate is an ambidentate ligand which can result in two forms in the entities it is present in. If it links through N atom, it forms nitrito-N form (NO2) as in figure i), and if it binds through O atom, it forms nitrito-O form (ONO) as in figure ii). This type of isomerism is called linkage isomerism.

5. Linkage isomerism is seen in compounds having ________ ligand.
a) unidentate
b) polydentate
c) chelate
d) ambidentate
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Ambidentate ligands can bind through either one of their two donor atoms and can result in different forms. These forms are called linkage isomers.

2. How many types of hybridisation are possible for complexes with a coordination number of 4?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: According to VBT, a complex with CN=4 can have two possible types of hybridisation and hence geometries. The sp3 hybridisation results in tetrahedral geometry and dsp2 hybridisation results in square planar geometry.

3. How many empty orbitals are available in the central metal ion of a complex that has a trigonal bipyramidal geometry?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: One of the assumptions of VBT is that the number of empty orbitals in the metal ion for making bonds with the ligands is equal to its CN. A trigonal bipyramidal geometry has a hybridisation of sp3d and hence a CN=5.

4. A complex having _________ geometry can have more than one type of hybridisation.
a) tetrahedral
b) square planar
c) trigonal bipyramidal
d) octahedral
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Complexes having octahedral geometry can have either sp3d2 or d2sp3 hybridisation depending on whether the outer or inner d orbitals are involved in hybridisation respectively.

5. Which statement regarding [Cr(NH3)6]3+ is incorrect?
a) It has octahedral geometry
b) It has d2sp3 hybridisation
c) It is diamagnetic
d) It is a low spin complex
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Cr3+ has six empty orbitals- two 3d, one 4s and three 4p orbitals, which are occupied by six electron pairs from six NH3 molecules to form six d2sp3 hybridised orbitals. This leaves, three unpaired 3d electrons, making it paramagnetic. Also, since the inner d orbitals are involved, it is a low spin complex.

    });



6. The ferricyanide complex ion is _________
a) paramagnetic
b) outer orbital
c) spin free
d) tetrahedral
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The oxidation state of Fe in [Fe(CN)6]3- ion is +3, which leaves it with five unpaired electrons in 3d orbitals. Two of these pair up leaving one unpaired electron in 3d and six vacant orbitals to form d2sp3 hybridised octahedral inner orbital complex.

a) 0
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The configuration of Fe2+ is 3d6. The complex has a CN=6 has should have sp3d2 hybridisation. This leaves the 3d orbitals as it is with 4 unpaired electrons.

    });



8. Identify the magnetic nature of the complex from its electronic configuration as shown.

a) Strongly paramagnetic
b) Weakly paramagnetic
c) Diamagnetic
d) Ferromagnetic
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: There is one unpaired electron in the 3d orbitals. The presence of unpaired electrons makes a complex paramagnetic. In this case, since only 1 unpaired electron is present, it is a weak paramagnet.

9. Coordination entities with only three ligand groups attached to the metal ion can have d2sp3 hybridisation.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: This happens in the case of didentate ligands which have six pairs of electrons from three molecules. For example, [Co(ox)3]3- has d2sp3 hybridisation and is diamagnetic.

    });



10. Identify the correct geometry and magnetic behaviour of the complex from the configuration shown.

a) Square planar, diamagnetic
b) Square planar, paramagnetic
c) Tetrahedral, diamagnetic
d) Tetrahedral, paramagnetic
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The hybridisation type of the complex is dsp2 which corresponds to square planar geometry. Because there are no unpaired electrons, it is diamagnetic.

11. Predict the geometry of the complex from the electronic configuration shown.

a) Linear
b) Square planar
c) Tetrahedral
d) Octahedral
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The hybridisation type is sp which involves only two orbitals, so the geometry has to be linear and the coordination number is 2.

12. [Co(en)2(NH3)Cl]2+ is known to be a diamagnetic complex. What is the type of hybridisation it shows?
a) dsp2
b) sp3
c) d2sp3
d) sp3d2
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Co3+ has 3d6 configuration. For a complex to be diamagnetic, it should have no unpaired electrons. So, the single electrons in the 3d orbital will have to pair up and form 3 pairs leaving two 3d orbitals vacant. This results in d2sp3 hybridisation.

13. The compound K4[Mn(CN)6] is diamagnetic.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The atomic number of Mn is 25 and the outer shell configuration of Mn2+ is 3d5. Four out of these five electrons pair up leaving 1 unpaired electron in 3d orbital and forming d2sp3 hybridisation. Thus, it is paramagnetic.

14. Identify the incorrect statement regarding VBT.
a) It does not explain the colour of coordination compounds
b) It is unreliable in the prediction of geometries of 4-coordinate complexes
c) It does not explain the kinetic stabilities of coordination compounds
d) It can distinguish between strong and weak ligands
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: One of the limitations of VBT is that it cannot differentiate between weak and strong ligands. The other options are also its limitations.

    });



8. Which of the following ligands is most likely to form high spin complexes in octahedral fields?
a) Cl–
b) OH–
c) C2O4–
d) CN–
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Cl- is the weakest field ligand in the given options. The splitting field Δo is small and the energy separation between the eg and t2g orbitals are narrower. Hence, the electrons tend to occupy the eg orbitals easily and are likely to have a greater number of half-filled orbitals.

9. What will be the electronic configuration of d5 in terms of t2g and eg in an octahedral field when Δo<P, where P is the energy required for pairing of electrons in a single orbital?
a) t2g5 eg0
b) t2g2 eg3
c) t2g3 eg2
d) t2g0 eg5
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: When the field splitting is less than the pairing energy, the energy gap between the two sets of d orbitals is small. This allows the electrons to occupy the higher energy orbitals once the lower orbitals are singly occupied. Thus, the configuration will be t2g3 eg2, with one electron in each orbital.

    });



10. Tetrahedral fields can easily form low spin complexes.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The splitting energy in tetrahedral fields is almost half of that of octahedral fields. Due to this, the orbital splitting energies are not very large, which makes it difficult for electron pairing and therefore low spin complexes are rarely formed.

11. Observe the orbital splitting diagram of a tetrahedral field and find the value of x.

a) 0.178
b) 0.267
c) 0.4
d) 0.44
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The value of x is asked in terms of Δo and not Δt. The t2 orbitals is at an energy of (2/5) Δt above the average energy. This is equal to (2/5) times (4/9) Δo = 0.178Δo.

12. As the crystal field splitting energy in octahedral field increases, the wavelength of light absorbed _________
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) May increase or decrease
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: If Δo is less (as in weak field ligands), the excitation energy will be the smallest and the largest wavelength will be absorbed. On the other hand, Δo is high (as in strong field ligands), the excitation energy will be the largest and the smallest wavelength will be absorbed.

13. The complex [Co(H2O)6]3+ absorbs the wavelength of light corresponding to orange colour. Predict the colour of the coordination compound based on this information.
a) Red
b) Yellow
c) Blue
d) Colourless
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: This is because of the concept of complementary colours. The colour of the complex is complementary to that which is absorbed and is generated from the wavelength that is left over.
14. Hexaaquatitanium(III) chloride is a coloured compound that loses its colour on heating.
a) True

Explanation: The angle between the two halogen atoms in meta isomer is 120° and let the dipole moments of C-Cl bonds be d=1.72D and let d’ be the dipole moment of the compound. So, by law of parallelogram of forces,
\(\Rightarrow \,d’ = \sqrt{d^2 + d^2 + 2d^2.cos(120°)}\) 
\(\Rightarrow \,d’ = \sqrt{1.72^2 + 1.72^2 – (2 \,x\, 0.5 \,x\, 1.72^2)}\) 
\(\Rightarrow \,d’ = \sqrt{1.72^2}\) 
\(\Rightarrow \,d’ = 1.72D\)

a) CH3Cl
b) CH2Cl2
c) CHCl3
d) CCl4
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The density of haloalkanes increases with the number of halogen atoms present in because of increase in molecular weight.

13. Haloalkanes are more soluble in water than in alcohols.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Haloalkanes are very slightly soluble in water due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules. However, they dissolve much more easily in organic solvents as the strength of new forces is similar to that of existing intermolecular attractions.

14. Which of the following has the lowest boiling point?
a) Bromomethane
b) Bromoform
c) Chloromethane
d) Dibromomethane
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Since boiling point increases with increases in molecular mass, chloromethane has the lowest molecular mass and hence the lowest boiling point.

6. Compared to haloalkanes, the reactivity of haloarenes towards nucleophilic substitution reactions is _________
a) low
b) high
c) very high
d) equal
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Haloarenes form resonating structures in which the carbon-halogen bond acquires a partial double bond character and its cleavage is difficult. Hence, they are less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reactions.

a) Chlorobenzene
b) 4-Chloronitrobenzene
c) 2,4-Dinitrochlorobenzene
d) 2,4,6-Trinitrochlorobenzene
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The presence of electron withdrawing groups like NO2 at ortho and para positions with respect to the halogen, increases the reactivity of the haloarene. Chlorobenzene has no such group and converts to phenol at the highest temperature and pressure.

9. 2-Chloronitrobenzene is more reactive than chlorobenzene.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Although NO2 is an electron withdrawing group, it is present at meta position with respect to chlorine in 2-Chloronitrobenzene and has no effect on the reactivity of the haloarene. This is because none of the resonating structures of m-nitrobenzene bear the negative charge on the carbon atom bearing the nitro group and as a result the presence of NO2 at meta position does not stabilize the negative charge.

    });



2. Alcohols and phenols are ________
a) Lewis acids
b) Lewis bases
c) Bronsted acids
d) Bronsted bases
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Alcohols and phenols are known to be acidic in nature based on their interaction with metals. They are able to donate a proton to a stronger base. Additionally, alcohols also act as Bronsted bases due to the presence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen.

3. What is the correct relation between acidic strength of primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols?
a) 1°>2°>3°
b) 1°<2°<3°
c) 1°=2°=3°
d) 1°>3°>2°
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Alkyl groups are electron releasing groups and tend to increase the electron density on oxygen and reduce the polarity of O-H bond. So, the greater the number of alkyl groups present, lesser will be the tendency to release protons, and therefore weaker will be the acidic strength.

6. The boiling point of ethers is ______ the boiling point of alcohols of comparable molecular mass.
a) lower than
b) similar to
c) little higher than
d) much higher than
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The large difference in boiling points of alcohols and ethers is due to the absence of intermolecular bonds in the latter.

7. Ethers are linear molecules with zero dipole moment.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Ethers have angular structures due to the polar nature of C-O bond because of the difference in electronegativity of C and O atoms. Since the two C-O bonds are inclined to each other at about 110°, the dipole do not cancel out, and there is some dipole moment.

        adpushup.triggerAd("21eae76a-c83f-42b0-aec5-01d590a53f37");
    });



8. Ethoxyethane is insoluble in water as compared to butanol.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Ethoxyethane and butanol have the same molecular mass and almost similar solubilities in water, i.e., 7.5g for ethoxyethane and 9g for butanol per 100ml of water. This is because of the fact that even ethers can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules just like the O of alcohols.

9. Which of the following is the least reactive functional group?
a) Alcohols
b) Ethers
c) Aldehydes
d) Ketones
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: This is because the (-O-) group in ethers does not contain any active site as compared to for example, hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols. However, they undergo C-O bond cleavage in drastic conditions.

10. One molecule of dialkyl ether produces how many molecules of alkyl halides with excess of halogen acid?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Dialkyl ethers when treated with excess halogen acid first form an alkyl halide and alcohol. The alcohol further reacts with the excess acid to form the same alkyl halide and a water molecule. Thus, two alkyl halide molecules are produced in the end.

11. What product(s) are formed when the shown ether is heated with hydrogen iodide?

a) (C6H5)CH2I and (C6H5)OH
b) (C6H5)CH2OH and (C6H5)I
c) (C6H5)CH2OH and (C6H5)CH2I
d) (C6H5)OH and (C6H5)I
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The C-O bond of the phenol group is stronger than the C-O bond of the ether and alkyl aryl group. This is due to the partial double bond character because of sp2 hybridised C-O cond. Therefore, the weaker C-O bond is broken and two major products, viz., phenol and iodomethyl benzene, are formed.

12. What is the major product of bromination of anisole in ethanoic acid?
a) o-Dibromobenzene
b) p-Dibromobenzene
c) o-Bromoanisole
d) p-Bromoanisole
View AnswerAnswer: d

    });



2. If the boiling points of methoxyethane and propanol are 281 K and 370 K respectively, predict the boiling point of propanal.
a) 273 K
b) 281 K
c) 322 K
d) 370 K
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The boiling point of aldehydes are higher than those of non-polar hydrocarbons of comparable molecular masses. However, their boiling points are lower than comparable alcohols, due to the absence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

3. Which of the following is the least soluble in water?
a) Methanal
b) Ethanal
c) Propanone
d) Pentanal
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The lower aldehydes and ketones are miscible in water in all proportions due to the ability of the polar carbonyl group to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, the solubility rapidly decreases as the length of the alkyl chain increases. Precisely, aldehydes and ketones with more than 4 carbon atoms are practically insoluble in water.

    });



4. Propanal has a slightly higher boiling point than propanone.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Propanone has two CH3 groups, one on either side of the CO group, whereas propanal has only one CH3CH2 group. This makes propanone more polar because of the higher electron releasing effect of two alkyl groups. The boiling point of propanal is 322K and that of propanone is 329K.

5. Two compounds A and B were being tested for their boiling points. It was observed that A started boiling after B, when both were subjected to same conditions. If the compound B is acetone, which of the following can be compound A?
a) n-Butane
b) Methoxyethane
c) Propanal
d) Propanol
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: It can be inferred that B has a higher boiling point than A. Since hydrocarbons, ethers and aldehydes have lower boiling points than ketones of similar molecular masses, none of them can be compound A. Also, alcohols have a higher boiling point than similar ketones hence, the compound A is propanol.

« Prev - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Preparation of Aldehydes and Ketones» Next - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Aldehydes and Ketones Chemical Reactions – 1 
This set of Chemistry Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Aldehydes and Ketones Chemical Reactions – 1”.
1. Aldehydes and ketones undergo __________ reactions.
a) electrophilic addition
b) electrophilic substitution
c) nucleophilic addition
d) nucleophilic substitution
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Aldehydes and ketones have a polar CO group which also has a double bond. The incoming nucleophile attacks the sp2 hybridised carbon, thus breaking the double bond and converting it into sp3, and forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. This undergoes another fast step to form an addition product.

        adpushup.triggerAd("e25be634-2f62-4ed5-978b-3aaec04c8aca");
    });



2. Which of the following is added to the tetrahedral intermediate when it reacts with a proton from the reaction medium?
a) Nu–
b) H+
c) Both Nu– and H+
d) OH–
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: A H+ proton is added to the negative O atom of the alkoxide intermediate to form an electrically neutral addition product. The Nu– is added in the first step itself when it attacks the electrophilic carbon centre in a slow step.

3. The nucleophilic addition reactions of aldehydes are carried out in ________ medium.
a) neutral
b) acidic
c) weakly basic
d) extremely basic
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: When the incoming nucleophile is weak, the acidic medium helps in protonation by increasing the positive charge on the carbonyl carbon so that it is more susceptible to attack by relatively weaker nucleophiles.

    });



4. What is the correct order of reactivity of the following towards nucleophilic addition?
a) Methanal > Ethanal > Acetone
b) Acetone > Ethanal > Methanal
c) Methanal > Acetone > Ethanal
d) Ethanal > Methanal > Acetone
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Methanal is the most reactive among aldehydes and ketones due to electronic and stearic reasons. Methanal (HCHO) does not have any alkyl groups that release electrons toward carbonyl carbon, thus making it more electrophilic. Also, presence of only two H atoms do not provide any hinderance to the attack of incoming nucleophile.

5. Which of the following is least reactive towards a nucleophilic attack?
a) Acetaldehyde
b) Butanone
c) Diisopropyl ketone
d) Ditert-Butyl ketone
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The stearic effects come into consideration when comparing these compounds. Ditert-Butyl ketone has two very bulky tert-butyl groups, one on either side of the carbonyl carbon. This increases the hinderance to the incoming nucleophile and decreases the reactivity.

    });



6. What is the correct order of reactivity towards nucleophilic addition?
a) Benzaldehyde > Benzophenone > Acetophenone
b) Benzophenone > Benzaldehyde > Acetophenone
c) Acetophenone > Benzaldehyde > Benzophenone
d) Benzaldehyde > Acetophenone > Benzophenone
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Generally, the aromatic carbonyl compounds are less reactive than corresponding aliphatic compounds. From benzaldehyde to acetophenone to benzophenone, the number of electron releasing groups increases and the magnitude of positive charge on carbonyl carbon reduces, hence decreasing its reactivity towards nucleophile attack.

7. Which of the following is the most reactive towards hydrogen cyanide?
a) Acetophenone
b) Benzaldehyde
c) p-Nitrobenzaldehyde
d) p-Tolualdehyde
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Addition of hydrogen cyanide is a nucleophilic reaction. CH3 and COCH3 are electron releasing groups which decrease the positive charge on carbonyl carbon, whereas NO2 is an electron withdrawing group which increases the electrophilicity of carbonyl carbon, making it more reactive toward hydrogen cyanide than benzaldehyde.

    });



8. Identify the catalyst in the nucleophilic addition of HCN to acetone.
a) NaOH
b) HCl
c) NaCl
d) NaCN
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Acetone reacts with HCN to give a cyanohydrin of acetone. But this reaction proceeds very slowly with pure HCN. So, the reaction is carried out in a basic medium which removes the proton from HCN and produces CN– ion which is a stronger nucleophile and makes the reaction faster.

9. The hydrolysis of the addition product of acetone and methyl magnesium iodide gives _______
a) ethyl alcohol
b) isopropyl alcohol
c) tert-Butyl alcohol
d) phenol
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The methyl group of Grignard reagent is the nucleophile which initially get attached to the carbonyl carbon of acetone. This results in three methyl groups attached to the carbon atom and one OMgI group. This MgI is replaced by H+ on hydrolysis to give tert-Butyl alcohol. Similarly, methanal gives ethyl alcohol (1°) and other aldehydes give 2° alcohols.

10. The following is an addition product of the reaction between _______ and sodium bisulphite.

a) formaldehyde
b) acetaldehyde
c) ethanone
d) acetone
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Acetaldehyde reacts with NaHSO3 to form a crystalline bisulphite addition compound. First, the nucleophile HSO3– attaches to the carbonyl carbon, after which the hydrogen gets attached to the oxygen atom on proton transfer.

11. The following acetal shown is formed by the reaction between ______ and ______ in the presence of dry HCl.

a) methanal; methanol
b) methanal; ethanol
c) ethanal; methanol
d) ethanal; ethanol
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Ethanal and ethanol react in the presence of dry HCl to initially form an unstable hemiacetal having one ethoxy (OC2H5) and one hydroxy (OH) group. This further reacts with ethanol to form the gem-diethoxy compound, acetaldehyde ethyl acetal as shown.

12. Acetone reacts with ethylene glycol in dry HCl gas to form _________
a) hemiacetals
b) acetals
c) cyclic acetals
d) cyclic ketals

b) ethanoic acid
c) acetone
d) ethanol
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Aldehydes are easily oxidised to carboxylic acids with same number of carbon atoms, in the presence of oxidising agents like HNO3, KMnO4, etc. This is because of the presence of H atom next to CO group, which can be easily converted to OH group with any bond cleavage.

5. What are the major products of the oxidation of pentan-2-one with concentrated HNO3 at very high temperatures?
a) Butanoic acid and methanoic acid
b) Propanoic acid and ethanoic acid
c) Pentanoic acid
d) Butanoic acid and ethanoic acid
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Ketones undergo oxidation accompanied by C-C bond cleavage to give a mixture of carboxylic acids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone. In case of petan-2-one (which is unsymmetrical), the cleavage occurs such that the CO group stays with the smaller alkyl group (Popoff’s rule). Hence, the bond between C-2 and C-3 will be broken to give a mixture of ethanoic acid and propanoic acid.

d) Acetophenone and benzophenone
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Iodoform test involves the reaction of a compound with sodium hypoiodite to detect the presence of CH3CO or CH3CH(OH) group. A positive test forms CHI3 (iodoform) in the form of a yellow precipitate. Acetaldehyde and acetophenone give yellow ppt in this test, whereas formaldehyde, benzophenone and benzaldehyde do not undergo this test due to the absence of CH3CO group in their structures.

11. Which of the following does not give yellow ppt on iodoform test?

a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Ethanal and propanal both contain α-hydrogen atoms and undergo aldol condensation to form a mixture of four products. The self-aldol products of ethanal and propanal are but-2-enal and 2-methylpent-2-enal respectively. The two products formed from the cross-aldol condensation between one molecule of ethanal and one molecule of propanal are 2-methylbut-2-enal and pent-2-enal.

14. Identify the product A of the following reaction.

a) Phenol
b) Benzyl alcohol
c) Acetophenone
d) Benzophenone
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Benzaldehyde does not contain any α-hydrogen and undergoes self- oxidation and reduction on treatment with conc. NaOH. One molecule of it is oxidised to carboxylic acid salt, and the other molecule is reduced to an alcohol (A). This is known as Cannizzaro’s reaction.

15. Formaldehyde cannot undergo aldol condensation as well as Cannizzaro’s reaction.
a) Trues
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b

6. Which of the following is not a reason for carboxylic acids having higher boiling point than alcohols of comparable molecular masses?
a) Presence of electron withdrawing carbonyl group
b) Higher polarity of OH bond than in alcohols
c) Formation of two hydrogen bonds to form cyclic dimers
d) Presence of more alkyl groups in carboxylic acids
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The OH bond in carboxylic acids is more strongly polarised due to the presence of adjacent electron withdrawing CO group. This results in stronger hydrogen bonds. Also, the presence of alkyl groups should increase the polarity of OH bond as they are electron releasing in nature. Furthermore, carboxylic acids form two hydrogen bonds between molecules compared to the only one between alcohols.

7. What is the correct order of boiling points of the following?
a) HCOOH > CH3COOH > C2H5COOH
b) C2H5COOH > CH3COOH > HCOOH
c) HCOOH > C2H5COOH > CH3COOH
d) CH3COOH > HCOOH > C2H5COOH
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The boiling points increase with the increase in molecular mass, because as the size of alkyl group increases, the magnitude of van der Waal forces increases, thus making the bonds difficult to break.

a) 322 K
b) 329 K
c) 370 K
d) 390 K
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Acetic acid and propanol both have same molecular mass. Acetic acid should have a higher boiling point than propanol because of its stronger hydrogen bonds and the fact that it forms cyclic dimers.

9. Boiling point of aromatic carboxylic acids are higher than that of comparable aliphatic carboxylic acids.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: This is because benzene ring has a planar structure and can pack more closely in the crystal lattice than aliphatic acids, which have a zig-zag structure. The melting of aromatic acids are also usually higher due to the same reason.

    });



2. The pKa value is equivalent to ________
a) logKa
b) -logKa
c) logKeq
d) -logKeq
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Keq is the equilibrium constant of a reaction and Ka is the acid dissociation constant which is Keq[H2O]. The strength of an acid is generally by its pKa value rather than its Ka value.

a) -7
b) 4.2
c) 7
d) 10
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Generally, carboxylic acids are weaker acids than mineral acids like hydrochloric acid. Also, mineral acids are strong with pKa values usually less than 1. Hence, the pKa value of carboxylic acids will be higher.

    });



4. What is the relation between the acidic strength of A and B?

a) A = B
b) A > B
c) A < B
d) A >> B
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Compound A has a methoxy group (electron donating) and compound B has nitro group (electron withdrawing). In simple terms, the electron withdrawing groups stabilise the carboxylate ion and strengthen the acid, whereas electron donation groups weaken the acid.

5. Which of the following is the stronger acid?
a) Acetic acid
b) Propanoic acid
c) Isobutyric acid
d) 2,2-Dimethylpropanoic acid
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: As the size of alkyl group (electron releasing) increases, the electron density on the O of OH group increases, and makes release of H+ ion more difficult. Thus, the release of proton from acetic acid will be easier compared to the higher acids, and is therefore the stronger acid.

    });



6. Which of the following is the strongest acid?
a) CH3COOH
b) CH2ClCOOH
c) CHCl2COOH
d) CCl3COOH
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The -I inductive effect increases as the number of Cl atoms (electron withdrawing substituents) increases. The carboxylate ion becomes more stable as more negative charge is dispersed, thereby strengthening the acid.

7. Which of the following has the highest pKa value?
a) Bromoacetic acid
b) Chloroacetic acid
c) Fluoroacetic acid
d) Iodoacetic acid
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Higher the electronegativity of a halogen, greater will be its electron withdrawing effect, and stronger will be the acid. Since electronegativity of halogens decrease in the order F > Cl > Br > I, iodoacetic acid will be the weakest and hence will have the highest pKa value.

8. Which of the following will have the highest acidic strength?
a) Butanoic acid
b) 2-Chlorobutanoic acid
c) 3-Chlorobutanoic acid
d) 4-Chlorobutanoic acid
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Halogen substituted carboxylic acids are stronger acid than their respective parent acids, because of the electron withdrawing and stabilizing nature of the halogen. Furthermore, as the distance of the halogen form the COOH group increases, the electron withdrawing influence decreases, and therefore the acidic character decreases.

9. What is the correct order of acidity of the following?
a) Acetic acid > Acrylic acid > Propiolic acid
b) Acetic acid > Propiolic acid > Acrylic acid
c) Propiolic acid > Acrylic acid > Acetic acid
d) Acrylic acid > Propiolic acid > Acetic acid
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The electronegativity of carbon increases from sp3 to sp2 to sp hybridisation. The carbon attached to the carbonyl carbon of propionic acid id sp hybridised (due to triple bond) ang has a higher inductive effect on the COOH group and as a result has higher acidity compared to acrylic acid (sp2 carbon) or acetic acid (sp3 carbon).

10. It is given that the following compound has a higher pKa value than benzoic acid. Which is the most probable substituent group X of the compound?

a) OH
b) Cl
c) CN
d) NO2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Given that the compound has a higher pKa value than benzoic acid, it should have weaker acidic strength than benzoic acid. This means, that X should be an electron donating group that destabilises the compound and reduces its acidic strength. Since is an electron releasing group, the X group should be OH.

11. Acrylic acid is a stronger acid than benzoic acid.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Both compounds contain a sp2 hybridised carbon atom next to the COOH group, but the double bond of a benzene ring is less electron releasing in nature than the vinyl carbon double bond of acrylic acid. This is because delocalisation in the resonance structures of benzoic acid destroys its aromatic character. Hence, benzoic acid is stronger than acrylic acid.

12. What is the correct order of pKa values of the following acids?
a) Benzoic acid > m-Nitrobenzoic acid > p-Nitrobenzoic acid
b) Benzoic acid > p-Nitrobenzoic acid > m-Nitrobenzoic acid
c) p-Nitrobenzoic acid > m-Nitrobenzoic acid > Benzoic acid
d) m-Nitrobenzoic acid > p-Nitrobenzoic acid > Benzoic acid
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Nitro group is electron withdrawing in nature and increases the acidic strength of acids. The electron withdrawing effect of NO2 is pronounced at para position more than meta position, hence the p-isomer is more acidic and has a lower pKa value than m-isomer.

13. Which of the following is the most acidic?
a) Benzoic acid
b) o-Toluic acid
c) m-Toluic acid
d) p-Toluic acid
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Although CH3 is an electron releasing group and should reduce the acidic character of acids by destabilizing it, the presence of CH3 group at ortho position has a reverse effect and increases the acidic strength compared to benzoic acid. This is due to a combination of stearic and electronic factors.

14. Which of the following has a higher acidic character than benzoic acid?
a) Acetic acid
b) p-Methoxybenzoic acid
c) p-Bromobenzoic acid
d) p-Aminobenzoic acid
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Bromine is an electron withdrawing group that disperse the negative charge on the carboxylate ion and strengthens its acidic character. p-Bromobenzoic acid has a pKa value of 3.96 compared to 4.19, which is the pKa value of benzoic acid.

15. The presence of CF3 group in an acid gives a higher acidic strength compared to the presence of NO2.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: CF3 group is highly electronegative due to the presence of three F atoms and has a greater electron withdrawing and stabilizing influence on carboxylate ion than NO2 group.

a) methane
b) ethane
c) methanol
d) ethanal
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Sodium acetate undergoes decarboxylation (loss of CO2) when heated with soda lime. This is proceeded by the loss of COONa from the sodium salt and NaO from sodium hydroxide. They combine to form CH4 and Na2CO3. The hydrocarbon formed has one less carbon atom than the parent acid.

7. Which of the following acids on Kolbe’s electrolysis gives ethane?
a) HCOOK
b) HCOONa
c) CH3COOK
d) CH3CH2COONa
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Aqueous solutions of sodium or potassium salts of carboxylic acids on electrolysis, undergo decarboxylation and form hydrocarbons having twice the number of carbon atoms as present in the alkyl group of the acid. Since ethane has two C atoms, the alkyl group of the acid should be CH3.

This set of Chemistry Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Structure of Amines”.
1. Which of the following is not an amine?
a) NH3
b) CH3NH2
c) C6H5NH2
d) CH3NHCH3
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Amines are clearly defined as ‘derivatives’ of ammonia obtained by replacement of one or more H atoms by an alkyl/aryl group. Therefore, NH3 itself is not an amine, but the base compound for all amines.

    var adpushup = adpushup || {};
    adpushup.que = adpushup.que || [];
    adpushup.que.push(function() {
        adpushup.triggerAd("e25be634-2f62-4ed5-978b-3aaec04c8aca");
    });



2. Amines are derivatives of ______
a) NCl3
b) NH3
c) N2
d) CH3NH2
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: There are three hydrogen atoms in ammonia. When one or more of these is substitutes by an alkyl/aryl group, the resultant compound is an amine. Hence, they are derivatives of NH3.

3. How many lone pairs of electrons does the nitrogen atom of amines have?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) 3
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The nitrogen of NH3 forms sp3 hybridised orbitals and also a valency of three (as it is attached to three hydrogen atoms). This results is one the orbitals having a lone pair of electrons, resulting in one unshared electron pair on nitrogen.


advertisement


    var adpushup = adpushup || {};
    adpushup.que = adpushup.que || [];
    adpushup.que.push(function() {
        adpushup.triggerAd("e5da93a0-b61a-4789-96be-a57ebec165b0");

        adpushup.triggerAd("7cee830d-5f11-4a2b-b356-93cc453475a0");
    });



4. What is the geometry of ammonia molecule?
a) Trigonal planar
b) Square planar
c) Linear
d) Pyramidal
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The nitrogen atom of ammonia undergoes hybridisation to form 4 sp3 orbitals. Three of these overlap with s orbital of H forming three N-H bonds. This results in a pyramidal geometry with N atom at the apex and three H atoms at the corners of a triangle base.

5. What is the expected geometry of CH3-NH-CH3?
a) Square planar
b) Trigonal planar
c) Trigonal pyramidal
d) Trigonal bipyramidal
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: CH3-NH-CH3 is an amine in which two hydrogen atoms are replaced by methyl groups. The hybridisation of N atom of amines is same as that of ammonia, and is also expected to have a pyramidal geometry, with N at the apex and the groups CH3, H and CH3 occupying the corners of a trigonal base.

    });



6. What is the bond angle in ammonia molecule?
a) 106.5°
b) 107°
c) 108°
d) 109.5°
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The bond angle for a standard tetrahedral geometry is 109.5°. But the ammonia molecule contains a lone electron pair on nitrogen. As it is closer to the N atom than the other orbitals, it creates a repulsive effect and pushes the Hydrogen atoms close to each other, thus reducing the bond angle to 107°.

7. What is the C-N-C bond angle in the following compound?

a) 107°
b) 108°
c) 109°
d) 109.5°
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The shown compound is an amine with three methyl group. This induces a steric effect between the three alkyl groups, and results in a slight increase in bond angle from 107° (bond angle in ammonia).

    });



8. An amine with two or more alkyl groups does not have a lone pair of electron on nitrogen atom.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Amines are derivatives of ammonia. Nitrogen of NH3 is sp3 hybridised with one orbital having unshared pairs of electrons as it bonds to only three H atoms. Similarly, amines also have an electron lone pair on nitrogen.

a) Ethylenediamine
b) 1,2-Diaminoethane
c) Ethyldiamine
d) Aminoethylamine
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In this compound, more than one amino group is present at different positions in the parent chain. Both the amino groups are given equal importance and none of them is considered a substituent on the other. The prefix di- is used before amine, and since it is a disubstituted ethane, it is referred to as ethylene.

5. What is the correct IUPAC name of H2N-(CH2)5-NH2?
a) Pentan-1,5-diamine
b) 1,5-Diaminopentane
c) Pentamethylenediamine
d) Pentane-1,5-diamine
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The parent carbon chain consists of five atoms with one amino group at each end, i.e., first and fifth carbon. The prefix di is used to indicate the two amino groups and the letter ‘e’ of the suffix part of pentane is retained. Hence, the name pentane-1,5-diamine.

a) CH3I > CH3Br > CH3Cl
b) CH3I > CH3Cl > CH3Br
c) CH3Cl > CH3Br > CH3I
d) CH3Br > CH3Cl > CH3I
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Iodine is the most electropositive atom of chlorine and bromine halogens. This makes it more susceptible to a nucleophilic attack than towards Cl or Br. Hence, CH3I is more reactive towards ammonolysis.

12. Ammonolysis is a reaction between an alkyl halide and most preferably an ______ solution of NH3.
a) alkaline
b) acidic
c) alcoholic
d) aqueous
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: An alcoholic medium promotes the occurrence of a nucleophilic attack of NH3 molecule on the alkyl/benzyl halide. Generally, ethanol is used for this purpose.

a) Benzylamine
b) N-Methylphenylmethanamine
c) N,N-Dimethylphenylmethanamine
d) N,N-Dichlorophenylmethanamine
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Benzyl chloride reacts with ethanolic ammonia to form benzylamine (A) which reacts with one molecule of CH3Cl to give N-methyphenylmethanamine, which further reacts with one more molecule of CH3Cl to give N, N-dimethylphenylmethanamine.

14. Only primary amine is formed as the main product when ammonolysis of an alkyl halide takes place with large excess of ammonia.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: When NH3 is taken in excess in the reaction mixture, the alkyl halide is more likely to react with an NH3 molecule rather than with a molecule of amine which is present in smaller amount. Therefore, only primary amine is formed as the main product.

15. Which of the following would not be a good choice for reducing an aryl nitro compound to an amine?
a) H2/Pt
b) LiAlH4-ether
c) Fe and HCl
d) Sn and HCl

6. Which of the following has a lower boiling point than ethanamine?
a) Propane
b) Ethanal
c) Ethanol
d) Methanoic acid
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: All given compounds have similar molecular masses and can be compared. Ethanamine has a higher boiling point than propane because it is a polar molecule and forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds. However, it has a lower boiling point than ethanal, ethanol and methanoic acid as the O-H bonds in these compounds is more polar than the N-H bond in ethanamine. This makes the hydrogen bonds stronger.

7. If the boiling point of diethylamine is 329 K, predict the boiling point of ethyldimethylamine.
a) 310 K
b) 329 K
c) 340 K
d) 351 K
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Diethylamine is a 2° amine whereas, ethyldimethylamine is a 3° amine. In 3° amines, there are no hydrogen atoms available for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the tertiary amines have lowest boiling point among the primary and secondary counterparts.

8. If the boiling point of n-C4H9NH2 is 351 K, what will be the boiling point of n-C4H9OH?
a) 329 K
b) 301 K
c) 351 K
d) 390 K
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Alcohols have higher boiling points than amines of comparable molecular masses. This is because the electronegativity of N is lower than that of O, which results in the OH bond in alcohols being more polar and hence stronger (in hydrogen bonding) than the N-H bond in amines.

9. If A is the boiling point of propanamine and B is the boiling point of butanamine, what is the correct relation between the two?
a) A > B
b) B > A
c) A = B
d) A >> B
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Butanamine is a larger molecule than ethanamine. As the carbon chain increase, the magnitude of van der Waals forces increases resulting in the increase in boiling point.

10. All aliphatic amines exist as associated molecules due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Only primary and secondary amines form intermolecular hydrogen bonds as they have individual at least one hydrogen atom to form bonds with. Tertiary amines do not have intermolecular association due to absence of hydrogen atom available for hydrogen bonding.

11. Which of the following amines are insoluble in water?
a) Methanamine
b) Ethanamine
c) Propanamine
d) Benzenamine
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Lower aliphatic amines are soluble in water as they easily form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Higher amines containing six or more carbon atoms are insoluble in water due to a large hydrophobic alkyl/aryl part. Therefore, aniline is insoluble in water.

12. If ‘x’ ml of butan-1amine and ‘y’ ml of butan-1-ol is completely soluble in 100ml of water each, what is the relation between x and y?
a) x > y
b) x < y
c) x = y
d) x + y = 100
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Alcohols are more polar than amines of comparable molecular masses and form stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water. Therefore, the solubility of butan-1-ol is more than that of butan-1-amine.

13. Aniline is insoluble in which of the following solvents?
a) Ethanol
b) Ethoxyethane
c) Benzene
d) Water
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Aromatic amines have a very large hydrocarbon part (benzene ring) which tends to retard the formation of hydrogen bonds with water. However, they are soluble in organic solvents like ethers, alcohols and benzene.

14. Which of the following is least soluble in water?
a) CH3CH2NH2
b) CH3CH2OH
c) HCOOH
d) CH3NH2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Lower amines are more soluble because of the smaller hydrophobic alkyl part. Also, alcohols and carboxylic acids have higher solubility than amines because of the greater polarity of OH bond than NH bond.

15. Primary amines are more soluble than tertiary amines of same formula.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Solubility in water requires the presence of free hydrogen in the structure of a compound to form hydrogen bonds. Tertiary amines do not have any hydrogen attached to the N atom and are not soluble in water.

1. Amines are generally ______ in nature.
a) electrophilic
b) acidic
c) basic
d) neutral
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Amines behave as nucleophiles due to the presence of unshared pair of electrons on N atom. This also makes them proton acceptor, and react with acids to form salts.

    });



2. Which of the following is associated with decrease in pKb value of amines?
a) Increase in acidic strength
b) Increase in basic strength
c) Better proton donation
d) Better electron acceptor
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The basic strength of amines is expressed in terms of dissociation constant Kb. Greater the Kb value, stronger the base. It is more commonly expressed as pKb=-logKb. Hence smaller the value of pKb, more is the basic strength of the amine.

3. The equilibrium constant of the reaction of amines with _____ is taken as a measure of its basic character.
a) an acid
b) a base
c) water
d) a Lewis base
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: For the reaction,
RNH2 + H2O ↔ RNH3+ + OH–, the dissociation constant is,
Keq = ([RNH3+][OH–])/([RNH2][H2O])
\(\Rightarrow\) Keq[H2O] = ([RNH3+][OH–])/[RNH2] 
\(\Rightarrow\) Kb = ([RNH3+][OH–])/[RNH2]

4. What is the product formed when ethanamine reacts with HBr?
a) NH4Br
b) CH3NH3Br
c) CH3CH2NHBr
d) CH3CH2NH3Br
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Since amines are basic in nature, they react with acids to form salts of ammonium. Ethanamine (CH3CH2NH2) reacts with HBr in a reversible reaction to form ethylammonium bromide through addition.

5. The reaction between methylamine and hydrogen iodide results in the formation of a _______
a) colourless liquid
b) dark coloured gas
c) white solid
d) yellow liquid
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Methylamine and hydrogen iodide are allowed to mix at very cold temperatures for about 2 hours. The resulting product is allowed to evaporate and methanaminium iodide (CH3NH3I) is obtained in the form of a white powder.

6. Which of the following is not produced on the reaction of methylammonium chloride with sodium hydroxide?
a) HCl
b) CH3NH2
c) H2O
d) NaCl
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Amine salts on treatment with a base like NaOH gives back the parent amine along with a water molecule and a salt. For example, CH3NH3Cl with NaOH gives methanamine , water and sodium chloride.

7. Identify X and Y respectively in the following reaction.

a) OH–, HCl
b) HCl, OH–
c) H2O, OH–
d) HCl, H2O
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Aniline undergoes addition in the presence of HCl to give anilinium chloride (salt) which on action with OH– ions (from a base like NaOH) gives back aniline.

    });



8. What is the correct order of pKb values of the following amines?
a) Methanamine > Ethanamine > Benzenamine
b) Benzenamine > Ethanamine > Methanamine
c) Ethanamine > Methanamine > Benzenamine
d) Benzenamine > Methanamine > Ethanamine
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The higher pKb value means lower basic strength. This means that benzenamine has the lower basic strength among methanamine and ethanamine. This is because of the electron withdrawing nature of the aryl group. Also in primary amines, the increase in size of alkyl group increases +I effect leading to high electron density on N atom and as a result higher basicity.

9. The treatment of N,N-dimethylaniline with acetic acid gives no reaction.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: N,N-Dimethylaniline reacts with acetic acid to form a salt, N,N-dimethylanilinium acetate. This is due to the basic nature of amines.

10. If the pKb value of ammonia is 4.75, predict the pKb value of methanamine?
a) 3.38
b) 4.70
c) 8.92
d) 9.38
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Aliphatic amines are stronger bases than ammonia and hence have a much lower pKb than ammonia. This is because of the electron donating nature of alkyl groups which increase the negative charge on nitrogen atom, making it less prone to electron acceptance.

11. If the Kb values of ammonia, methylamine and ethylamine are x, y and z respectively, identify the correct relation between x, y and z from the following.
a) x > y
b) y < z
c) x > z
d) x > y > z
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Larger the value of Kb, stronger is the base. Since ethylamine is a stronger base than methylamine which is stronger than ammonia, due to the effect of alkyl groups, the Kb vale of methylamine will be less than that of ethylamine (y<z).

12. Consider three gaseous alkylamines A, B and C or 1°, 2° and 3° respectively. What will be the correct order of their basicity?
a) A > B > C
b) C > B > A
c) B > A > C
d) B > C > A
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In the gaseous state, the solvation effect is missing and hence the expected order of basicity will be 3° > 2° > 1°. This is because as the number of alkyl groups increase, the +I effect strengthens and more negative charge is accumulated on the N atom. This makes the unpaired share mire available for sharing with the proton of the acid.

13. The basic strength of alkylamines does not depend on which of the following?
a) Number or alkyl groups
b) Size of alkyl groups
c) Physical state of the amine
d) Presence of an aromatic ring
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Since only basicity of alkylamines is in question the presence of aromatic ring is not considered. As the size and number of alkyl groups increases, the stability of ammonium ion (formed from the amine) increases due to dispersal of more positive charge by the +I effect of alkyl groups. The physical state, gaseous or aqueous, also determines the basicity as the hydration effect comes into play.

14. What is the correct order of basicity of aliphatic amines purely on the basis of solvation effect of the ammonium cation?
a) 1° > 2° > 3°
b) 3° > 2° > 1°
c) 2° > 1° > 3°
d) 2° > 3° > 1°
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In aqueous phase, the greater the size of the ion, lesser will be the hydration and less stabilised is the ion. Since the stability of ions is directly proportional to the basic strength of amines, primary amines will be the most basic and tertiary amines will be the least basic. This order is completely opposite to that based on the inductive effect of alkyl groups.

15. Stearic hinderance of alkyl groups has an effect on the basic character of amines.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: When the alkyl group is small, there is no stearic hinderance to hydrogen bonding. But when the alkyl group size or number increases, there will be hinderance to formation of hydrogen bonds, and this affects the order of basic strength of amines.

« Prev - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Amines Physical Properties» Next - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Amines Chemical Reactions – 2 
This set of Chemistry Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Amines Chemical Reactions – 2”.
1. If p, q and r are the pKb values of methylamine, N-methylamine and N,N-dimethylamine respectively, what is the correct order of p, q and r?
a) p > q > r
b) r > q > p
c) q > p > r
d) r > p > q
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: This peculiar order of basic strength is due to a combination of inductive, solvation and stearic effects of the alkyl groups in the amines. In methyl substituted amines, the solvation effect superimposes the inductive effect to make CH3NH2 more basic than (CH3)3N. The 2° compound is the most basic because of its higher inductive effect than primary amine and higher solvation than tertiary amine.

    });



2. What is the correct order of basic strength of the following ethyl substituted amines in aqueous solution? (R=ethyl group)
a) RNH2 > R2NH > R3N
b) R2NH > R3N > RNH2
c) R3N > R2NH > RNH2
d) R2NH > RNH2 > R3N
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: There is a subtle interplay of inductive effect, solvation effect and stearic hinderance of alkyl groups to determine the order of basicity of alkylamines in aqueous solutions. For ethyl substituted amines, it is 2°>3°>1°

3. If the pKb value of N,N-diethylethanamine is 3.25, predict the pKb value of ethanamine.
a) 3.00
b) 3.29
c) 4.75
d) 9.38
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In ethyl substituted amines (aqueous), the inductive effect has a bigger role than the solvation effect (because the size of ethyl is larger than methyl group), and as a result the basic strength of N,N-diethylethanamine will be higher than that of ethanamine. Thus, the pKb value of the latter will be very slightly higher than the former.

4. Which of the following aromatic amines has lower pKb value than ammonia?
a) Benzylamine
b) Benzenamine
c) N-Methylbenzenamine
d) N,N-Dimethylbenzenamine
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In aryl amines, the N atom is directly attached to the benzene ring. This makes the lone pair of N to be in conjugation with the benzene ring, thus making it less available for protonation. Whereas, benzylamine is a primary arylalkyl amine and has higher basic strength than ammonia.

5. Which of the following amines will be most reactive when treated with HCl?
a) N-Methylmethanamine
b) N,N-Dimethylmethanamine
c) N-Ethylethanamine
d) N,N-Diethylethanamine
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Between methyl substituted and ethyl substituted aqueous amines, the latter will have relatively higher Kb values due to the ethyl group being larger than methyl group. Of the ethyl substituted amines, the secondary amine will be the most basic because of the combined inductive and solvation effect of alkyl group. Thus, being the most basic, it will react faster with HCl.

    });



6. How many more resonating structures does aniline have than anilinium ion?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Aniline has five resonating structures, out of which three of them have a positive charge on nitrogen. This results in unavailability of electron pair for protonation. When aniline accepts a proton, it forms anilinium ion which has only two resonating structures and is less stable and more basic than aniline.

7. Which of the following groups when present at para position increases the basic strength of aniline?
a) NO2
b) Br
c) NH2
d) COOH
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Electron donating groups at para position release electrons towards the nitrogen atom, stabilizes the anilinium cation and hence increase the basic strength. Since NH2 is an electron donating group, p-phenylenediamine will be more basic than aniline.

    });



8. Identify X if the shown compound has a higher pKb value than aniline.

a) OH
b) CH3
c) NH2
d) Cl
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The compound has a higher pKb value than aniline means that it has a lower acidic strength than aniline. This is possible is X is an electron withdrawing group (Cl) that destabilizes the anilinium cation and reduces the basic strength.

9. 4-Aminobenzoic acid has a lower pKa value compared to aniline.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Lower pKa value means more acidic, that is less basic, which means a higher pKb value than aniline. 4-Aminobenzoic acid can be thought of as aniline with COOH group substituted at para position. Since COOH is electron withdrawing in nature, it reduces the basic strength of aniline.

10. Which of the following is the least basic amine?
a) p-Bromoaniline
b) p-Chloroaniline
c) p-Nitroaniline
d) p-Aminobenzonitrile
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: All the compounds can be considered as aniline with an electron withdrawing (deactivating) group substituted at the para position to NH2. Since nitro group is the most deactivating group compared to halogen and cyanide, p-nitroaniline is the least basic compound.

11. Which of the following will have the highest pKb value?
a) C6H5NH2
b) p-C6H5(CH3)NH2
c) p-C6H5(OCH3)NH2
d) p-C6H5(NH2)NH2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: CH3, OCH3 and NH2 are all electron donating groups. When these are substituted at para position in aniline, it stabilizes the respective anilinium ion formed and thus increases the basic strength. Therefore, aniline is the weakest base from the given compounds and will have the highest pKb value.

12. Identify the correct order of basic strength of the following substituted anilines?
a) p-Methylaniline > m-Methylaniline > p-Nitroaniline > m-Nitroaniline
b) p-Methylaniline > m-Methylaniline > m-Nitroaniline > p-Nitroaniline
c) p-Nitroaniline > m-Nitroaniline > p-Methylaniline > m-Methylaniline
d) p-Nitroaniline > m-Nitroaniline > m-Methylaniline > p-Methylaniline
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The base weakening effect of electron withdrawing group (NO2) and the base strengthening effect of electron donating group (CH3) is more prominent at para position than at meta position.

13. If ‘a’ is the pKb value of aniline and ‘b’, ‘c’ and ‘d’ are the pKb values of o-, m- and p- isomers of methylaniline respectively, what is the correct order of the values a, b, c and d?
a) a > b > c > d
b) d > c > a > b
c) d > c > b > a
d) b > a > c > d
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Every ortho substituted aniline (electron withdrawing or electron releasing group) is less basic than aniline and consequently its meta and para isomers. This is because of the ortho effect, which is due to the combination of stearic and electronic factors.

14. If the pKb value of p-nitroaniline is 13, predict the pKb value of its ortho isomer?
a) 9.38
b) 11.54
c) 13
d) 14.22
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: NO2 is an electron withdrawing group and has a weakening effect on the basicity of anilines. Its presence at para position will be more influencing than at meta, but less weakening than at ortho position. This anomaly is due to a complex ortho effect (stearic and electronic reasons). Hence o-nitroaniline is a weaker base and has a higher pKb value than p-nitroaniline.

15. Phenylmethanamine is more basic than benzenamine.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In arylalkyl amines, the lone pair od electrons on N is not conjugated with the benzene ring and is not delocalized. Hence, the lone pair of electrons on n atom inn arylalkyl amines is more readily available for protonation than that on the N atom of benzenamine.

1. If x and y are the pKb values of p-methylaniline and N,N-dimethylaniline, what is the relation between x and y?
a) x > y
b) x < y
c) x = y
d) x >> y
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The basicity of N-methyl anilines is very slightly higher than that of ring substituted methyl anilines. This is because the methyl group is directly attached to the N atom in N,N-dimethylaniline and the electron effect is more pronounced. But this is only a minute effect.

2. What is the correct order of basic strength of the following compounds?
a) Aniline > Diphenylaniline > Triphenylaniline
b) Aniline > Triphenylaniline > Diphenylaniline
c) Diphenylaniline > Triphenylaniline > Aniline
d) Triphenylaniline > Diphenylaniline > Aniline
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: When hydrogen atoms of amino groups are replaced by electron withdrawing groups (in this case, phenyl group), the basic character of the resulting aryl amine decreases.

3. Alkylation of amines with alkyl halides proceeds by _________
a) electrophilic addition
b) electrophilic substitution
c) nucleophilic addition
d) nucleophilic substitution
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The amines itself acts as nucleophiles and attack the alkyl halide at the carbon-halogen bond to substitute the halogen atom by itself. This occurs by production of small amount of acid at each step, which may prevent the reaction by proceeding by protonating the amine.

    });



4. Which of the following is not a likely product of the alkylation of amines with methyl iodide?
a) Primary amine
b) Secondary amine
c) Tertiary amine
d) Quaternary ammonium salt
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Primary and secondary amines react with alkyl halide to form tertiary amines by nucleophilic substitution. When a primary or secondary amine acts as the nucleophile, a secondary or tertiary amine is generated respectively. Finally, the tertiary amine reacts with the remaining methyl iodide to form quaternary ammonium iodide salt.

5. The alkylation of amines with alkyl halides is carried out in the presence of which of the following?
a) Alcohol
b) Acid
c) Base
d) LiAlH4
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Some amount of strong acid is produced at each step of alkylation. This acid can protonate the amine, making the electron lone pair of N unavailable for nucleophilic attack and therefore halt the reaction. For this reason, the acid needs to be neutralised and hence, a base is needed during the reaction.

8. The reaction shown below gives ________

a) N,N-dimethylmethanamide
b) N,N-dimethylethanaminde
c) N-methylethanamide
d) no reaction
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The amine that is treated with CH3COCl is a tertiary amine (N,N-dimethylmethanamine). It does not undergo reaction with acetyl chloride as it does not have a replaceable hydrogen atom. Therefore, for the acylation of an amine, a H atom on nitrogen is required along with the lone pair of electrons.

9. The reaction between ethanamine and acetyl chloride will give N-ethylethanamide only in the presence of a strong base, like pyridine.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: A base like pyridine may be used in the acylation of amines only to increase the concentration of the product formed. The base removes the HCl formed during the reaction and shifts the equilibrium to the right-hand side.

10. What are the products formed from the reaction between aniline and ethanoic anhydride?
a) N-Phenylethanamide and hydrochloric acid
b) N-Phenylethanamide and acetic acid
c) N-Methylbenzamide and acetic acid
d) N-Methylbenzamide and hydrochloric acid
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The H atom attached to nitrogen of aniline is replaced by COCH3 group of ethanoic anhydride. This forms N-phenylethanamide (or acetanilide). The by product (acetic acid) is formed by the attachment of the H atom from aniline with remaining CH3COO part of ethanoic anhydride.

11. What is the product of the benzoylation of aniline in the presence of aqueous NaOH?
a) N-Ethylethanamide
b) N-Ethylbenzamide
c) N-Phenylethanamide
d) N-Phenylbenzamide
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Amines react with benzoyl chloride (C6H5COCl) in the presence of a base to form benzoyl derivatives in which the C6H5CO– group is introduced. This is called benzoylation reaction.

12. Which of the following amines does not undergo benzoylation?
a) N-Methylethanamine
b) N-Ethylethanamine
c) N,N-Dimethylethanamine
d) N-Methylbenzenamine
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: For benzoylation to take place, there should be a hydrogen atom present at the nitrogen of the amine for the C6H5CO– group to replace. This is not the case in tertiary amines like N,N-dimethylethanamine and hence they do not undergo benzoylation.

13. A certain amine ‘X’ when heated with chloroform and alcoholic KOH, produced no reaction. Identify ‘X’ from the following.
a) Methylamine
b) Ethylamine
c) Ethylmethylamine
d) Aniline
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: When an amine is heated with CHCl3 and alc. KOH and does not give any reaction, it indicates that it is a secondary or tertiary amine. This is called as carbylamines test and the compound ‘X’ will be ethylmethylamine, as it is 2° and fails the test.

14. Which of the following compounds is not formed during the heating of ethylamine with chloroform in ethanolic KOH?
a) Propanenitrile
b) Ethyl isocyanide
c) Potassium chloride
d) Water
View AnswerAnswer: a

10. Aniline is a _______ directing compound.
a) ortho
b) meta
c) ortho and para
d) ortho, meta and para
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The ortho and para positions with respect to NH2 group in aniline are centres of high electron density. This is due to the resonance structures of aniline. Thus, NH2 is ortho and para directing and a powerful activating group.

11. The activating effect of -NHCOCH3 group is ______ as compared to -NH2 group.
a) less
b) same
c) more
d) very high
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The -NHCOCH3 group forms two resonance structures, where the lone pair of nitrogen interacts with the lone pairs on oxygen atom. This makes the lone electron pair on N less available for donation to benzene ring.

a) ortho > meta > para
b) para > ortho > meta
c) para > meta > ortho
d) meta > para > ortho
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Nitration of aniline produces nitro derivatives. Under controlled conditions, aniline is protonated (by strong acidic medium) to form anilinium ion, which is meta directing. Therefore, apart from p-nitroaniline (51%) and o-nitroaniline (2%), a significant amount of m-nitroaniline (47%) is also formed.

14. It is possible to obtain para isomers of anilines as the major product in electrophilic ring substitution of aniline.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: This is possible by protecting the amino group of aniline by reacting it with acetic anhydride (acetylation)  to give acetanilide. This compound on desired substitution reaction followed by hydrolysis gives para substituted aniline as major product.

4. Which form of glucose is obtained by crystallization from hot and saturated aqueous solution at 371K?
a) D-form
b) L-form
c) α-form
d) β-form
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: When a saturated aqueous solution is heated to about 100°C and then crystallized, the β-form of glucose is obtained. On the other hand, a concentrated solution at room temperature on crystallization gives α-form.

a) 0
b) 36
c) 64
d) 100
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: When either α or β forms of glucose are dissolved in water and are allowed to stand, an equilibrium mixture of both forms is formed (36% α-form and 64% β-form). This is due to a spontaneous change in specific rotation of an optically active compound with time to an equilibrium value. This phenomenon is called as mutarotation.

10. What is the correct name of the following compound?

a) D-(+)-fructose
b) D-(-)-fructose
c) L-(+)-fructose
d) L-(-)-fructose
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Since the OH group on the carbon adjacent to the last CH2OH group is on the right-hand side, it is of D configuration. Also, fructose is naturally a laevorotatory compound, hence the (-) sign.

11. The furanose structure of fructose is obtained by the interaction of groups at which carbon atoms?
a) C1 and C5
b) C1 and C6
c) C2 and C5
d) C2 and C6

12. Fructose exists as both pyranose and furanose structures.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In the free state, D-fructose exists as a six-membered ring (fructopyranose). However, in the combined state as a constituent in disaccharides, it exists in furanose form (five-membered hemiketal).

13. Identify the compound from the Haworth projection shown.

a) α-D-(+)-glucopyranose
b) β-D-(+)-glucopyranose
c) α-D-(-)-fructopyranose
d) β-D-(-)-fructopyranose
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: This is the pyranose structure of fructose, where the C2 keto group and C6 OH group are involved in cyclisation. The α and β forms in this structure differ based on the arrangement of CH2OH and OH groups around the C2 carbon. Since in this compound, the OH at C2 is in the same side as the OH at C3, it is the β-form.

14. A solution having equal amount of D-glucose and D-fructose is called _____ sugar.
a) invert
b) fruit
c) brown
d) cane
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: When sucrose is heated with water, it gives a mixture of glucose and fructose, called invert sugar. It is named as such because of the difference in optical activity of the initial sugar and the product mixture.

15. Fructose is commonly known as ______
a) dextrose
b) laevulose
c) pyranose
d) furanose
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Due to its laevorotatory behaviour, fructose is known as laevulose. On the other hand, glucose is known as dextrose for the opposite reason. Fructose can exist as furanose or pyranose depending on its state (free or combined).

4. Calculate the number average molecular mass of a polymer having four different monomers A, B, C and D present in equal number. The molecular masses of the monomers are 10000, 15000, 30000 and 50000 respectively.
a) 10050
b) 17350
c) 26250
d) 35475
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Since the 4 monomers are present in equal amount, there is 25% of each monomer in the polymer. The number average molecular mass is,
\(\Rightarrow\) Mn = (25×10000 + 25×15000 + 25×30000 + 25×50000)/(25+25+25+25)
\(\Rightarrow\) Mn = (250000+375000+750000+1250000)/100
\(\Rightarrow\) Mn = 2625000/100
\(\Rightarrow\) Mn = 26250.

5. The polydispersity index can be less than 1.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The weighted average molecular mass is always greater than the number average molecular mass. This is because of the 2-degree nature of Mw (because of squaring of masses). Hence PDI ≥ 1.

« Prev - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Polymers of Commercial Importance» Next - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Drug-Target Interaction 
This set of Chemistry Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Drug-Target Interaction”.
1. Drugs that block the binding site of an enzyme form a substrate are called ______
a) inhibitors
b) poisons
c) messengers
d) receptors
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Drugs that either prevent the enzyme from holding the substrate or prevent it from providing functional groups that attack the substrate, are called enzyme inhibitors. These inhibit the catalytic activity of enzymes.


advertisement


    var adpushup = adpushup || {};
    adpushup.que = adpushup.que || [];
    adpushup.que.push(function() {
        adpushup.triggerAd("e25be634-2f62-4ed5-978b-3aaec04c8aca");
    });



2. Which of the following drugs will inhibit the activity of the shown enzyme?

a) A
b) B
c) C
d) D
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The shape of the active site resembles a triangle, which means that the substrate should also have a similar shape. The drug that will inhibit the activity of this enzyme should closely resemble the substrate and block the active site. These are called competitive inhibitors.

3. All drugs block enzyme activity by occupying the active site before the substrate.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Drugs prevent the attachment of substrate to enzymes by two different ways. One is the competitive approach where it occupies the active site, and the other is non-competitive way in which it does not occupy the active site.


advertisement


    var adpushup = adpushup || {};
    adpushup.que = adpushup.que || [];
    adpushup.que.push(function() {
        adpushup.triggerAd("e5da93a0-b61a-4789-96be-a57ebec165b0");
    });




advertisement


    var adpushup = adpushup || {};
    adpushup.que = adpushup.que || [];
    adpushup.que.push(function() {
        adpushup.triggerAd("7cee830d-5f11-4a2b-b356-93cc453475a0");
    });



4. A certain compound X occupied a site of an enzyme exactly opposite to that of the active site. This immediately resulted in the change of shape of the active site. X is called a ______
a) competitive inhibitor
b) non-competitive inhibitor
c) competitive messenger
d) receptor
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Non-competitive inhibitors are drugs that affect the catalytic activity of enzymes by changing the shape of the active site by binding to the enzyme at some other site. This prevents the substrate from binding to the enzyme.

5. A certain compound occupied a site Y of an enzyme near to the active site. This immediately resulted in the change of shape of the active site. Y is called a/an ______
a) inactive site
b) binding site
c) non-competitive site
d) allosteric site
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: When a drug binds to an enzyme from a site other than the active site, it is called an allosteric site. Binding to this site causes the change in shape of active site such that the substrate cannot recognise it.

    var adpushup = adpushup || {};
    adpushup.que = adpushup.que || [];
    adpushup.que.push(function() {
        adpushup.triggerAd("fdd9bf87-4faf-4493-82b4-e5538b31931a");
    });



6. If the bond between the enzyme and inhibiting drug is very strong, which of the following takes place?
a) The active site slowly regains its original shape
b) The enzyme develops a new active site
c) The enzyme is blocked temporarily
d) The body synthesizes a new enzyme
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: When there is a strong covalent bond between the enzyme and the drug, the enzyme is blocked permanently. This results in the degradation of the entire drug-enzyme complex and the synthesis of a new enzyme.

7. Which of the following is incorrect regarding receptors?
a) They have constant shape
b) They are proteins
c) The shape of receptors binding site changes to fit the messenger
d) They are present in the cell membrane
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Receptors are proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane with the binding site protruding outwards. They change the shape of the binding site to accommodate the incoming messenger and facilitate communication.

    var adpushup = adpushup || {};
    adpushup.que = adpushup.que || [];
    adpushup.que.push(function() {
        adpushup.triggerAd("21eae76a-c83f-42b0-aec5-01d590a53f37");
    });



8. Which of the following is not a reason for the selectivity of receptors towards messengers?
a) Shape of binding site
b) Structure
c) Amino acid composition
d) Location in the membrane
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: There are lots of different types of receptors in the body at different locations. They interact with different kinds of chemical messengers. Their selectivity for one messenger over the other is because of the difference in their binding sites, structure and composition of amino acids.

9. The drugs that are used when there is a lack of natural chemical messenger is called ______
a) antagonists
b) agonists
c) analgesics
d) narcotics
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Agonists are drugs that replicate the behaviour and properties of the chemical messenger and activate the receptor. These are used when the actual messenger is not present in the body.

        adpushup.triggerAd("90f55663-effd-4105-b1e7-29d86b526544");
    });



10. Antagonists do not allow the transfer of message through receptors.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Antagonists bind to the receptor at the binding site and inhibit its natural communicative function. This prevents the message to be passed into the cell.

« Prev - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Drugs and their Classification» Next - Chemistry Questions and Answers – Therapeutic Action of Different Classes of Drugs – 1 
This set of Chemistry Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Therapeutic Action of Different Classes of Drugs – 1”.
1. Which of the following compounds help in controlling the acid production in the stomach?
a) Histamine
b) Cimetidine
c) Ranitidine
d) Omeprazole
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Histamine is the compound which is responsible for the secretion of pepsin and HCl in the stomach. Drugs like cimetidine (Tegamet), ranitidine (Zantac), omeprazole and lansoprazole prevent the interaction of histamine with the stomach wall receptors, resulting in release of lesser acid.
