      "explaination":"The size of the atoms of the elements decrease from left to right in the same period. Considering the row to be the same, the electrons are added to the same shell. However, the increase in atomic number reflects the increase in number of protons i.e. the positive charge. Hence, the overall effective nuclear charge increases. Consequently, the electron cloud is pulled even more closer to the nucleus of the atom. Therefore, the size decreases."

      "correctAnswer" : "d",
      "explaination":"Covalency of an atom refers to the number of electrons that atom can share to form chemical bonds. Usually it is the number of bonds formed by the atom. In case of nitrogen, its atom can share up to four electrons, one in the s-subshell and the other three in the p-subshell. In addition to this, absence of d-orbitals restricts its covalency to four only."

      "correctAnswer" : "d",
      "explaination":"The N – N single bond is highly weak and unstable due to high magnitude of inter-electronic repulsions of non-bonding electrons which in turn is caused by the single bond’s small bond length. As a result the catenation tendency becomes weaker due to the mentioned factors leading to instability."
